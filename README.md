# Nearest-Neighbors-Linear-SVM-SVM-with-RBF-Kernel
In this homework I tried to use two different supervised machine learning algorithms on the Wine dataset of scikit library to evaluate their performances on this data.

The k-nearest neighbors algorithm is a simple supervised machine learning algorithm that can be used to solve classification and regression problems. The principle behind it is to find a predefined number of training samples (K) closest in distance to the new point and predict the label from these.

The Linear SVM is a supervised learning model for linear classification and regression problems. The idea is to create a line which separates the data into classes. With RBF Kernel the algorithm finds a hyperplane for a non-linear classification, where implicitly mapping inputs into high-dimensional feature spaces.
